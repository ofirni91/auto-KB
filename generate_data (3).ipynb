The adjacent botanic gardens were also\\nlapped.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\nIngrid Meimich-Bache, 16, from Stavanger in Norway, studying in\\nOxford over the summer, said: \"Everyone jokes about the British\\nweather but I didn\\'t expect it to hit me.\"\\n</P>\\n<P>\\nNicole Jorwic, 23, a law student at Loyola University in the\\nmidwestern US city of Chicago, studying in Oxford over the\\nsummer, was more philosophical.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n\"We have been travelling for two months and it was like this when\\nwe were in Strasbourg (France) and other places, so it seems like\\nit\\'s par for the course in Europe,\" she said.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n\"I guess I\\'ll see summer when I get back to Chicago.\"\\n</P>\\n</TEXT>\\n</BODY>\\n</DOC>\\n\\n'"
