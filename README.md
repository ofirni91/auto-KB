Automated Knowledge Base Generation for Entity Linking: When Annotations are Limited
1.The "generate..." files notebooks the training/test data sets for the classifier for TAC and YAGO.
2.The "Paper pairs classifier" notebooks perform corss validation training for the classifier of TAC and YAGO and for the baseline classifiers.
3.The "Transfer learning" notebook train classifier which is based on all TAC and part of YAGO.
4.The "Clustering mentions" notebook outputs the entity linking knowledge base.

The running of the flow should be done similarly to the order above.
